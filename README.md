# A novel cuproptosis-related score can predict aggressiveness and prognosis in Lung adenocarcinoma by integrating bulk and single-cell transcriptome data
Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is a primary lung malignant tumor. Cuproptosis, a recently discovered cell death mechanism, targets lipoylated proteins in the tricarboxylic acid cycle. In previous studies, cuproptosis was found to be involved in tumor progression, but its role in LUAD remains unclear. Here, we analyzed the bulk and single-cell transcriptome data to reveal its role in LUAD. The cuproptosis related score (CuS) was constructed based on cuproptosis-related genes, and different cohorts validated the score stability. Lung adenocarcinomas with high CuS are more likely to have an aggressive subtype and poor prognosis. Function enrichment and immune cohort analysis showed that CuS was associated with tumor immune infiltration. Moreover, 6 potential drugs targeting high CuS lung adenocarcinoma were predicted according to the GDSC databases, including AZD4547, AZD3759, and others. In conclusion, cuproptosis is involved in lung adenocarcinoma aggressiveness, and may be used to assist in drug selection.
